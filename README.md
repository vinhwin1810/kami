### About The Project
This project is a better version of the Kami puzzle game ([Kami 2 on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stateofplaygames.kami2&hl=en&pli=1)), developed to enhance our understanding of Java development tools and software design patterns.  

It improves upon the original gameplay experience while serving as a practical exercise in:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- UML modeling
- Applying well-known design patterns
- Writing clean, maintainable code

The goal was to create a fun, interactive puzzle game while deepening our expertise in Java and software architecture.
